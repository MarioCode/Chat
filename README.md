### Client - Server application, Messenger

The —Årossplatform client is the messenger, which interacts with the [mobile client](https://github.com/MarioCode/WaveTalk)  and [desktop applications](https://github.com/MarioCode/Chat/tree/master/Client). Data transmission between devices is organized with using TCP sockets.

#### Client: 
Cross-platform program written in C ++ (Qt). Has a complete user-friendly interface, a lot of settings, support for encryption.

#### Server:
It is a centralized place for connecting clients, both desktop and mobile.
This server can be deployed not only for the Internet, but also for local work. To store user information used the SQLite database. 
Used partial multithreading and support at least 100 connections.

The development is aimed at creating a secure multi-user system for instant information exchange between users.
